# decision-tree-learning
This program utilized decision tree learning in order to predict outcomes. In order to run the program execute the program as follows. 

```
ruby decision.rb 'training set directory' 'outcome field' 'test set directory' 'outcome field'
```
where outcome field is the index of the field that specifies the outcome field within each example. Data sets are provided in the balloons, wdbc, and digits directories. When testing data within the digits directories, you should use the digitsDecision.rb file instead of the decision.rb file, since it needs to parse CSV formatted data.
